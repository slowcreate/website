                <p>The Ark First Edition is a publication of two never before seen texts by Paul Auster and Siri
                    Hustvedt in only six copies.
                    <br>
                    Paul Auster's ALONE is a short story from 1969 - supposably his earliest piece of prose ever to be
                    published. It deals with the subjects of artistic inspiration, literary burdens and whiteness. Also,
                    it introduces the earliest printed form of his world famous character Quinn from the New York
                    Trilogy.
                    <br>
                    Siri Hustvedt's Becoming the Other in Translation is an essay from 2014 written with this particular
                    publication in mind. It is concerned with the topic of literary translation and personal, as well as
                    artistic and intellectual, development. It is a personal and moving text with relevance to her
                    literary works.
                    <br>
                    The First Ark Edition is entirely handmade. It has two covers consequently dissolving authorial
                    hierarchy. In a sense the work is reminiscent of a classic leporello binding. However, unlike a
                    classic leporello binding, it has two spines.
                    After taking out both spines, one can keep reading it indefinitely. Putting back the spines, though,
                    it then reverts, and becomes a sealed box - a closed universe entirely.
