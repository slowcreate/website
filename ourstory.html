            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>
                Opened in 2014, Ark Books is a nonprofit shop offering a diverse collection of world literature,
                primerely in English.
                However we also feature books in German, French, and Spanish. With a focus on
                translations, we curate multiple versions of some titles.

                Our goal is to showcase both familiar and undiscovered literature from across the globe. Run by
                volunteers within an open and democratic association, our earnings cover rent, new books, events, and
                maintain low prices.

                We're a community-driven space, striving for inclusivity where everyone can freely enjoy books,
                discussions, and complimentary coffee or tea. Your presence is always warmly welcomed.</p>

            </div>
            <p>
                In 2011, the idea for ark books emerged over red wine and candlelight in Copenhagen. Two years
                later, a
                small room became available, triggering plans to create an international bookshop. Seeking funding
                proved challenging, as traditional avenues didn't fit. Instead, we turned to crowdfunding, rallying
                over 300 supporters to surpass our goal.


                With donations, loans, and personal savings, ark books took shape. Intensive preparations ensued,
                culminating in a whirlwind 20-day sprint to transform a tiny space into a bookshop. As the doors
                opened,
                unexpected newspaper coverage added to the surreal moment. The grand opening evolved into a lively
                street celebration.</p>

            <p>And that's the story of how a community-centered bookshop found its home in a small space on
                Møllegade
                10, born from passion, determination, and support from around the world.</p>

                        she leaves a massive carbon footprint annually; and is always searching for excuses to rest
                        under a tree with a novel and a glass of wine. She misses the Finnish forests; would like to
                        visit Cinemateket more often and ought to exercise more regularly. She has far to many
                        projects for her own good and can be found by following a trail of half finished cups of
                        coffee and/or tea.

                    <p>Alexander happily holds a Master’s degree in Comparative Literature from the University of
                        Copenhagen. He currently works for a literary agency where he spends his time staring out
                        the window and writing e-mails to obscure publishers in Eastern Europe. He is ostensibly a
                        volunteer at Ark Books, but no one can remember the last time he took a shift. For the Ark
                        Review he writes various analysis of literary things with Lacan as the theoretical
                        spearhead. A deceivingly brilliant field to pick of course, because no one understands
                        Lacan, and thus Alexander comes off as smart. He asks for all complaints or disagreements
                        concerning his articles be addressed to the big Other.

                    <p>Aspiring writer and avid reader of fiction. Has an odd penchant for white, American male
                        authors such as Don DeLillo, David Foster Wallace, and Jonathan Franzen. Likes to discuss
                        the failings of neoliberalism and other systems of oppression. Has yet to find a way to do
                        anything about them. Had her eyes opened by postcolonial and gender theory (which has yet to
                        do anything to her love of aforementioned white American male authors). Prefers Nescafé over
                        real coffee, which everyone in the bookshop finds strange. </p>
